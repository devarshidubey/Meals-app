# 4epicure: The Meals app
The 4epicure app aspires to become the ultimate destination for all epicures. Initially
limited to India, it has the potential to be extended to other countries, catering to the needs of
travelers, students, common people, diet conscious individuals, tourists, and others. The app will
provide a centralized platform where users can access all information related to meals, including
its segregation based on regions and an A-Z directory of the same.<br><br>
The app has been designed to offer region-based segregation of meals and recipes,
making it easier for users to discover local cuisine. Additionally, through the integration of
Google Maps, users can find popular recipes across different states in India. The app will also
provide nutritional information for each meal, including calorie counts, protein, carbohydrates,
and fat content presented in a graphical format. This information will be particularly useful for
health-conscious individuals.<br><br>
The 4epicure app also features a voice assistant that will provide step-by-step guidance
for recipe preparation. Users can search for specific meals or filter results based on dietary
restrictions, allergies, or other preferences. They can rate and review meals and recipes and
provide comments on recipes created by others. Personalized recommendations will be provided
based on the user's search history, ratings, dietary preferences, and available groceries.
The app supports multiple languages to cater to the diverse population of India.<br><br>
Additionally, it will send notifications if a particular meal is scheduled for preparation on a
particular day, based on the grocery list updated in the app. This feature helps users keep their
grocery items ready for the next day.

## Technologies used
The requirement elicitation stage of our 4epicure app involved various techniques for
modeling the use-case, class and sequence diagrams for our app. The techniques used included
use case analysis, requirements prioritization, functional decomposition, questionnaires and
surveys. Use case analysis helped us identify the functional requirements of the system, as well
as the processes and steps required to fulfill each use case. Requirements prioritization was
employed to identify the most important requirements and ensure that they were addressed first.<br><br>
Functional decomposition was utilized to break down the system into smaller, more
manageable components and to identify functional requirements and ensure that all necessary
functionalities were captured. Questionnaires and surveys were used to gather information from
stakeholders and end-users, providing valuable insights into the functional and non-functional
requirements, as well as user interface requirements.<br><br>
For the front end of our application, we used Flutter to create an app that serves the purpose of providing a stable and crossplatform 
application which is secure and scalable.
Django along with MySql is used in the server side. It is chosen because of its scalability, security and rapid speed of development.<br><br>
These techniques enabled us to form an in-depth understanding of the requirements for
our 4epicure app and helped us model an efficient and user-friendly solution.

## APIs
We have created APIs to communicate with the Recipe and Grocery model of the database. The map feature has been implemented in the front end where the regional dishes will be diplayed on google maps. The APIs will only cover the the Recipee search and CRUD part.
